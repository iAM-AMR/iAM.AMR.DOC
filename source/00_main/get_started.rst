Getting Started
===============
The following sections describe how to get started with the IAM.AMR project.

For New Collaborators
---------------------
If you've just joined the IAM.AMR project, welcome!

The first step in getting started is to make sure you've completed the short `onboarding survey and guide <https://uoguelph.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cBeTb8mUpkJPdvn>`_ (it may be what brought you to this documentation). This onboarding guide will collect some basic information and walk you through creating accounts you will need to work with the models and access other IAM.AMR project materials.

The next step is to explore this documentation! At a minimum, we suggest you read this section, and the :ref:`background <project/background:Background>` and :ref:`project outline <project/prostructure:Project Structure>` sections to get up to speed with the basics.

Finally, get modelling! If you're going to be working on, or developing the models, you'll need to install Analytica, and download the models from GitHub. If you're simply interested in running the models and not editing them, the instructions in the :ref:`for the public <project/get_started:For the Public>` section are more applicable to you.

Purchase Analytica
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The IAM.AMR models are built in `Analytica <https://lumina.com/>`_ (by Lumina Decision Systems), a popular graphical software environment for building, exploring, and sharing quantitative decision models. To edit or develop the models, you will need to purchase and install Analytica. An overview of Analytica, including a description of the available versions, is provided in the :ref:`Analytica <technology/analytica:Analytica>` section of this documentation.

.. tip:: To get started quickly, there is a `free version of Analytica <http://www.lumina.com/support/downloads/>`_ available. You will be able to view, run, but not edit the models. The installer is the same for all versions -- Analytica can be upgraded from free to a paid license from within the application.

Get access to the models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To access the most up-to-date versions of the models, you will need to be registered as a collaborator in the IAM.AMR GitHub repository. If you have completed the `onboarding survey and guide <https://uoguelph.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cBeTb8mUpkJPdvn>`_, you should have a GitHub account, and access to the repository shortly after completion. 

If you have not completed the onboarding guide, ensure you have a GitHub account (you can visit `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ to create an account). Then, contact the :ref:`IAM.AMR Repository Administrator <reference/roles:Roles>` and provide your GitHub username to be added as a collaborator.

If you have any difficulties accessing the repository, consult this :ref:`FAQ <reference/faqs:Why can I not access the IAM.AMR model repository?>`.

Once you have access, follow the instructions in the README to download the models.

   All of the project files (including models, and internal project information) can be downloaded as a ZIP file, using the large green 'Clone or Download' button.


For the Public

Welcome to the IAM.AMR project!

The first step in getting started is to explore this documentation! At a minimum, we suggest you read this section, and the :ref:`background <project/background:Background>` and :ref:`project outline <project/prostructure:Project Structure>` sections to get up to speed with the basics.

Then, run the models! To run the models, you'll need to install Analytica, and obtain a copy of the models.

Get Analytica
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The IAM.AMR models are built in `Analytica <https://lumina.com/>`_ (by Lunina Decision Systems), a popular graphical software environment for building, exploring, and sharing quantitative decision models.
