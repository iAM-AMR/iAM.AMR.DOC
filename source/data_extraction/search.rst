Literature Search
=================
Several comprehensive literature searches have been conducted to inform the IAM.AMR models. The first search was conducted in May of 2015, and was subsequently updated in June of 2016. A qualitative description of the included studies is available (see below).

As of May of 2019, the search is being repeated with a modified search string, designed to include addtional food-animal species and commodities, and additional bacterial species. Additionally, this search excludes human-related factors influencing resistance; human-related factors (e.g. AMU, immune status) will be identified in a seperate search at a later date.

Goal of the Literature Search
-----------------------------
The goal of the literature search is to identify, from existing literature, factors that potentially influence antimicrobial resistance in the agri-food production system.

What is a 'Factor'?
-------------------
The general definition of a ‘factor’ is a “circumstance, fact, or influence that contributes to a result or outcome”. Similarly, the term ‘driver’ is defined as “a factor which causes a particular phenomenon to happen or develop”. Despite their near interchangeability, the terms ‘factor’ and ‘driver’ are often interpreted differently in an epidemiological context; the term ‘factor’ is used more loosely, while ‘driver’ is generally reserved for those ‘factors’ with a purported causative relationship with their outcome.

In the context of the IAM.AMR project, we have defined a ‘factor’ as a practice or circumstance which influences the occurrence of AMR. This is an intentionally broad definition that does not consider the concept of causality; we consider any relationship between an exposure and outcome as a factor, whether or not we can elucidate a causal pathway.

.. tip:: A factor may have a clear, causal relationship, like the relationship between antimicrobial use and resistance. A factor may also have a statistical relationship, but lack a clear causal relationship, like a purported relationship between vacuum packaging and resistance.

Comprehensive literature search strings were developed and pretested in Medline to return records for both human and animal populations of (a) the frequency of antimicrobial use or resistance (results not presented) and (b) the factors potentially associated with antimicrobial use or resistance (results presented herein; Appendix 1). The characterization of associations was broad and was not limited to interpretations of statistical significance, but included non-significant, causal and correlative relationships, or possible spurious findings. The searches included multiple broad and specific search terms for antimicrobial susceptibility, antimicrobial use, and population (animal or human), and specific search terms for Campylobacter species, E. coli, and S. enterica, and searches were not limited to a particular study design (e.g., observational, experimental, field trials, mathematical models). Following the pre-test, Medline and three other databases were searched as follows: Agricola, Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, using database‐specific search strings adapted from the initial pretested Medline search string.
