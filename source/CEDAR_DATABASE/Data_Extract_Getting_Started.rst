This section provides instructions for data extraction into CEDAR. If you are not familiar with CEDAR, please review the :ref:`section on CEDAR <data_extraction/CEDAR:The CEDAR Database>`.

There are two types of data you will be extracting: reference-level data, which provides context for the outcome, and factor-level data, which describes the outcome itself. These data are entered in a reference-level form, and a factor-level form respectively.

On the :ref:`Add or Edit a Reference form <data_extraction/form_reference:The Add or Edit a Reference Form>`, you will extract reference-level information such as:

- study location
- study design
- reporting methods

On the :ref:`Add or Edit a Factor form <data_extraction/form_factor:The Add or Edit a Factor Form>`, you will extract factor-level information such as:

- the exposed and referent groups
- the host, microbe, and resistance tested
- counts, prevalences, or odds ratios describing the effect of the factor

.. note:: Only **counts**, **prevalences**, and **odds ratios** are extracted. Other result formats, such as relative risks, are not extractable for our purposes.
