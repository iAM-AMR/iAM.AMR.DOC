iAM.AMR Framework
=================

--------
Overview
--------

The iAM.AMR models are organized into *stories*, or collections of one or more drug-microbe-commodity combinations that together describe an important facet of resistance in the agri-food production system in Canada.

Each |smod| shares the same architecture, which allows us to:

- share common data and functions via linkable modules (small stand-alone models)
- integrate the models to simultaneously evaluate multiple stories

You can think of models and modules fitting together like puzzle pieces; similar models and modules *'click'* into one another to form a whole.

.. attention:: As a result of this *'pluggable'* framework, the iAM.AMR models are often distributed across multiple files -- ensure you have all the files you need to run your model.
