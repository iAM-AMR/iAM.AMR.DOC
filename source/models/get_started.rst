Model Directory
---------------
The models are organized by antimicrobial-microbe-commodity combinations that we call "*stories*". Use the `model directory <https://github.com/iAM-AMR/models>`_ to find and download *story models*.

The iAM.AMR *story models* rely on functions and parameters from the `iAM.AMR.HUB module <https://github.com/iAM-AMR/iAM.AMR.HUB>`_. 

**You must download both a story model and the Hub module**.


iAM.AMR.HUB Module
------------------

The iAM.AMR.HUB is a filed module (i.e. a separate .ANA file) that provides shared functions and parameters. The iAM.AMR *story models* require a copy of the **iAM.AMR.HUB module**; you can download the iAM.AMR.HUB `here <https://github.com/iAM-AMR/iAM.AMR.HUB>`_.

See **INSERT LINK** which explains models and modules.

.. hint:: The Hub module is so named for its hub-and-spoke implementation; each story model (spoke) connects back to the central hub, like spokes on a wheel.
