The IAM.AMR project relies heavily on free and open-source software. The authors would like to thank the developers that made these projects possible, and recognize the companies which provide paid or closed-source software and services at a discount for academic users.

For more information on free and/or open-source projects, see the `Open Source Initiative <https://opensource.org/>`_ and the `Free Software Foundation <https://www.fsf.org/>`_.

Installation on GoC computers
-----------------------------
The installation of software on Government of Canada (GoC) computers is managed remotely by Shared Services Canada (SSC) and the National Service Desk (NSD). The GoC’s *Acceptable Use Policy* clearly states that users should not install unapproved software on GoC machines. Proceed at your own risk.

.. tip:: The following instructions use C:/myprograms as an example installation directory. You can install these programs in any writable directory.

Mendeley
~~~~~~~~
1. Download the latest version of `Mendeley here <https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/>`_.
2. Right-click on the installer and select '7-Zip > Extract to "Mendeley-Desktop-###-win32"'. This will create a new folder in your current directory.
3. Navigate to the root of your C:/ drive, and if it doesn't already exist, create a new folder called 'myprograms'.
4. Move the folder you created in step 2 into the myprograms folder.
5. Navigate to the folder (within C:/myprograms/), and locate the 'MendeleyDesktop.exe' executable. Right-click on MendeleyDesktop.exe and select 'Send to > Desktop' to create a shortcut.
6. Launch Mendeley from your newly created shortcut.

R and R Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install R
+++++++++
1. Download the latest version of R from the University of Toronto `here <http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/bin/windows/base/release.htm>`_.
2. Navigate to the root of your C:/ drive, and if it doesn't already exist, create a new folder called 'myprograms'.
3. Run the installer and select your preferred language.
4. When prompted, click ‘Next’ to acknowledge the warning about administrator privileges, and ‘Next’ to accept the licensing agreement.
5. Now, select a destination location by using ‘Browse’. Navigate to and select the ‘myprograms’ folder, in the root of your C:/ directory. The installer will automatically append a folder name to this path, according to the R version number. Click 'Next'.
6. Click 'Next' on all subsequent screens to accept the default installation options, and complete the installation.

Install RStudio
+++++++++++++++
1. Download the latest zipped version of RStudio from the `downloads page <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>`_.

.. tip:: Ensure you download the Windows Vista/7/8/10 zip file, not the .exe installer. These are located under the **Zip/Tarball** heading.

2. Right-click on the zip file and select 'Extract All'. This will create a new folder in your current directory.
3. Navigate to the root of your C:/ drive, and if it doesn't already exist, create a new folder called 'myprograms'.
4. Move the folder you created in step 2 into the myprograms folder.
5. Navigate to the folder (within C:/myprograms/), and locate the 'rstudio.exe' exexutable within the 'bin' folder. Right-click 'rstudio.exe', and select 'Send to > Desktop' to create a shortcut.
6. Launch RStudio from your newly created shortcut.

If you are prompted during RStudio’s installation, choose the most appropriate version of R from the ‘Choose a specific version of R’ dropdown. If there are none listed, use ‘Browse…’ to navigate to the ‘bin’ sub-directory of your installation, and select ‘R.exe’.

If you have multiple versions of R installed and you would like to choose a different version after RStudio has been installed, you can make the selection from Tools > Global Options.
