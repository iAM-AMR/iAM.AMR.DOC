Welcome
-------
Welcome to the iAM.AMR project's public documentation, hosted by `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_.

For more information, internal documentation, and project downloads, see the `iAM.AMR project's GitHub Organization <https://github.com/iAM-AMR>`_.


Introduction
------------
The goal of the iAM.AMR project is to use an *Integrated Assessment Modelling* approach to understand how *factors* (e.g., on-farm practices, regulatory actions)  influence the relative occurrence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in specific *microbe-commodity* combinations, and subsequently the effect of these factors on Canadiansâ€™ relative exposure to resistant pathogens arising from the agri-food production system.

In short, the iAM.AMR models track the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance patterns(s) in *antimicrobial-microbe-commodity* combinations (e.g., the prevalence of third-generation cephalosporin resistant *Salmonella* spp. in broiler chickens), from the earliest point of data availablility in the production continuum, to retail. Along the way, the prevalence is adjusted by factors (whose effect is quantified/extracted from the scientific literature) at discreet stages along the continuum. 

Using demographic data and consumption patterns, we represent our results as the relative change in the number of consumption events of the commodity contaminated with the antimicrobial-microbe combination.
