Data Extraction Tips & Tricks

Factor-Level Extraction
-----------------------

Defining the factor itself
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What do I do if ...

**... it is not clear which factors are considered relevant points of comparison, and which are not**

Factors listed here are considered "unmodifiable" or "immutable", and thus not relevant for our purposes:

- :ref:`Immutable Factors <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Immutable Factors>`

For examples of extractable factors, please see:

- :ref:`Common Factor Types <data_extraction/form_factor:Common factor types>`
- :ref:`Binary and Continuous Factors <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Binary and Continuous Factors>`

**... I'm confused about how to extract a factor**

If you're confused about a factor, reach out on Slack for clarification. Additionally, add a :ref:`note <data_extraction/form_reference:Notes and Issues Tab>` to indicate why the factor was extracted in that way.

**... I want to compare conventional, ABF, organic, 'welfare' or 'humane' production systems**

:ref:`Common Factor Types <data_extraction/form_factor:Production type>`

Selecting exposed and referent groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Groups are otherwise referred to as levels.

What do I do if...

**... I am not sure which is which?**

:ref:`Selecting a Referent Level <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Selecting a Referent Level>`

**... a group is not clearly defined (i.e. an "Other" group)?**

:ref:`Non-informative Levels <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Non-informative Levels>`

**... there are more than two designated groups in the study?**

:ref:`Multiple Discrete Levels (Categories) <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Multiple Discrete Levels (Categories)>`

:ref:`Non-informative Levels <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Non-informative Levels>`

Selecting the sample type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Which sample type should be extracted if multiple (i.e. fecal, water, dirt...) sample types are available?

:ref:`Sample Type <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Sample Type>`

Choosing the microbe subtype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What do I do if...

**... a microbe subtype is not listed in the dropdown in CEDAR**

For Salmonella species:

- :ref:`Salmonella Species <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Provisional Rules>`

Factor data
~~~~~~~~~~~

What do I do if...

**... the data are only available in a figure**

If factor data are only available in a figure (i.e. no numbers are given on a graph, or in text), and the numerical value cannot be determined with certainty (i.e. is not zero or 100%), indicate this using the :ref:`notes <data_extraction/form_reference:Notes and Issues Tab>` field, and skip extracting the factor.

**... multiple data formats (i.e. a contingency table and a prevalence table) are available for a factor**

:ref:`Multiple Data Formats <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Factor Data>`

**... measurements are provided for multiple time points**

:ref:`Multiple Production Stages <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Multiple Measurements>`

:ref:`Multiple Timepoints Within a Single Production Stage <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Multiple Measurements at a Single Stage>`

:ref:`Multiple Timepoints Within the Farm Stage <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Multiple Measurements at Farm>`

**... the study uses SIR (Susceptible, Intermediate, and Resistant)**

If a study includes an 'Intermediate' category, add the intermediate isolates/prevalence to the resistant category (i.e. we round up intermediate to resistant).

**... odds ratios from both multi-variable and univariable analyses are available**

:ref:`Odds Ratio Extraction <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Factor Data>`

**... there are zero observations of resistance in both the exposed and referent groups**

:ref:`Zero Observations of Resistance <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Factor Data>`

**... the results are in log(Odds) or an estimate/coefficient of a logistic regression**

Recall that the Odds Ratio = e^x, where x is the coefficient.

**... the data are presented only as a relative risk**

We cannot use relative risk at this time. Do not extract the factor's data, but indicate the omission by attaching a note to the associated reference through the :ref:`Notes and Issues tab <data_extraction/form_reference:Notes and Issues Tab>`.

**... the study reports multi-drug resistance (MDR)**

:ref:`MDR Rules <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Resistances and MDR>`

**... the study reports genomic data on AMR**

:ref:`Genomic data <data_extraction/data_extract_rules:Provisional Rules>`

General
-------

What do I do if...

**... there are no factors to extract**

If there are no factors to extract, indicate this using the :ref:`Exclude Extraction Reason <data_extraction/form_reference:Exclusion Status>` field, and skip the reference.

**... an item I need is missing from a dropdown**

If an item is missing from a dropdown (i.e. a non-free-text field), reach out on Slack. If the decision is made to use an alternative item in the list, add a note to justify this replacement.
