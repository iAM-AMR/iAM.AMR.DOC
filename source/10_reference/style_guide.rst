==========================

Appending a suffix on 'model' requires the insertion of a second 'l':  

- e.g. 'modeller'; 'modelling'

The following should always be hyphenated or (not hyphenated) as follows:

- Model-builder
- End-user
- Farm to fork pathway
- Agri-food chain

Common Definitions
------------------

Antimicrobial resistance: 
   An in vitro measure to interpret a bacteriaâ€™s ability to resist compounds intended to inhibit bacterial growth and/or kill the bacteria.

Baseline probability (p\ :sub:`o`\):
   The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance at the earliest site of measurement in the defined agri-food chain (e.g., prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in broiler chicks at placement in the barn). 

Estimated probability (p\ :sub:`E`\):
   The estimated probability of antimicrobial resistance leaving a node in the iAM.AMR after adjustment of the baseline probability by the 1) odds ratios, and 2) frequencies of occurrence of factors potentially associated with antimicrobial resistance. Depending on the location of the node in the model, the estimated probability may become the baseline probability of resistance for the next node (e.g., baseline for abattoir node (p\ :sub:`A`\) or baseline for retail node (p\ :sub:`R`\)) or the final probability in the model (F\ :sub:`P`\). 

Factor: 
   A measured observation, such as antimicrobial use, different types of management systems, disinfectant use at slaughter plants, and packaging at retail. 

iAM.AMR: 
   Integrated Assessment Model for Antimicrobial Resistance.

Integrated assessment model: 
   A modelling approach that synthesizes data from many sources (e.g., different areas of study, varying methods, diverse disciplines, scales of measurement, sources of uncertainty) that intends to address some of the complexity within systems to support decision-making and/or policy interventions.

Local sensitivity analysis: 
   An approach to describe changes in a model outcome(s) at a single node (e.g., estimated probability) with a change (including infinitesimal changes) in one or more of the other input model parameters (e.g., baseline probability, odds ratio).    

Node: 
   An element within the iAM.AMR that represents a particular site (e.g., farm) within the system of interest (e.g., broiler chicken production industry).

Scenario: 
   Antimicrobial resistance to an antimicrobial/antimicrobial class in a specific bacterial genus/species in a defined host population (e.g., extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Salmonella from broiler chicken).

Site: 
   A generic location (e.g., farm) in the system of interest (e.g., broiler chicken production industry) that is represented by a node in the iAM.AMR.
