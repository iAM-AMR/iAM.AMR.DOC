## Citation

The recommended citation is:


### DOI

We use [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) to generate DOIs for our documentation.

Zenodo provides a static DOI for the project (a *concept* DOI), and a *version* DOI for each GitHub release ([more details](https://help.zenodo.org/#versioning)). 

#### Concept DOI

> You can use the Concept DOI representing all versions in citations when it is desirable to cite an evolving research artifact, without being specific about the version.

#### Version DOI

> You should normally always use the DOI for the specific version of your record in citations. This is to ensure that other researchers can access the exact research artefact you used for reproducibility. By default, Zenodo uses the specific version to generate citations.
